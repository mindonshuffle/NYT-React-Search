# New York Times React Article Search

### A React-based SPA to query the NYT Articles API and save selected articles

This app allows the user to query the New York Times archive by inputting a search term along with start and end years to limit the search window. The first ten articles matching the search critera will be displayed along with a save button. When the save button is clicked, the article will be saved to a MongoDB database.

If the user selects the "Saved Articles" link at the top of the screen, the app will display all previously saved articles along with a delete button. The delete button will remove that selected article from the database.
